# .emacs.v
My vanilla [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) configuration.
This config uses [rougier's](https://github.com/rougier) [nano-emacs](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs) as a base.

I don't use Emacs, this was a just-for-fun thing, even when I did use Emacs for a lil while, I used to use [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs).
For my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) config, check out [nvim-config](https://github.com/samarthkulshrestha/nvim-config).
